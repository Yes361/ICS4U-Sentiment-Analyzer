## Description 

This project is for my ICS4U1 Project

## How to Use it?

### GUI

For the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The Load Sentiment Dictionary button loads the sentiment dictionary, typically the default one included for this project can be found
in the *src/dictionary* directory

The Load Files button loads files you wish to be analyzed (example files are in *src/input*)
To remove files you can select them on the files catalog and then click remove

You can select files to analyze or deselect all of them and have it analyze everything,
and you can change the scorer by clicking on the dropdown

You can save the report by clicking the save report button and choosing which folder to put it in
(you should put it in *src/output*)

output file path
