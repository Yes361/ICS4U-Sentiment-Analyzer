That sweet, squishy bite of pineapple makes me sick.
It’s the worst topping imaginable.
I don’t get why people like it.
Cheese and fruit? No thanks.
I’d rather have plain pizza.
Even anchovies make more sense.
It feels wrong in my mouth.
Why would anyone do this?
Pineapple belongs in smoothies, not ovens.
It’s input culinary abomination!
