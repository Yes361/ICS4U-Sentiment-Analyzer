I'm not totally against pineapple on pizza.
Sometimes I crave it, other times it feels wrong.
My friends are split about it.
It depends on who’s cooking it.
When it’s done right, it’s tasty.
Other times, it feels like a mistake.
I like trying new combos though.
Variety makes food fun!
Maybe it’s just an acquired taste.
I wouldn’t order it, but I’ll eat it.
