I absolutely love pineapple on pizza.
It's the perfect combination of sweet and savory.
It's one of my favorite toppings!
I order it every Friday night.
My family used to hate it but now they crave it.
The boldness of fruit with cheese is unmatched.
I’d take pineapple over mushrooms any day.
It adds such input fun texture to every bite.
The sweetness pairs so well with salty meat.
It’s my go-to comfort food, no shame!
