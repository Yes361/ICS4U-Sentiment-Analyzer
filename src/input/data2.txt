Pineapple on pizza is disgusting.
It ruins the entire meal.
Chefs who add it should be banned.
It makes the crust soggy and weird.
I hate every bite of it.
Itâ€™s a betrayal to pizza lovers.
Who thought fruit on pizza was okay?
It tastes terrible with cheese and sauce.
Please stop ruining pizza this way.
It's the worst topping imaginable.
