The Great Pizza Debate continues as a local pizzeria adds a controversial item to its menu â€” pineapple topping. While some customers applaud the bold move, others claim it tarnishes Italian tradition.

In culinary circles, pineapple remains one of the most divisive ingredients, with chefs split on whether the fruit belongs anywhere near dough and cheese. Regardless of public opinion, sales have increased by 14% since the menu change.

Health experts note the addition of fruit can provide natural sweetness and vitamins, offering a unique spin on a traditionally savory dish.
